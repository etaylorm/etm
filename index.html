								<span class="image right"><img src="images/newyork.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hi, I'm Evelyn.</p>
								<p>I'm a software engineer with a background in data analytics and consulting. I currently work in Python, have significant experience with Java, and loved writing C and Assembly in college.
								<br><br>
								In my current role at Uplift Financial - an 11-person personal finance start-up - I am responsible the maintence and monetization of our product: upliftfinancial.com. Over the last year, I've integrated 7 business partner APIs that now drive 55% of monthly revenue, increased the test coverage of critical scripts from 18% to 85%, and have lead the conceptualization, development, and monitoring of countless AB tests that have resulted in a cumulative 3X in value per arrival on our web properties.
								<br><br>
								In addition to my engineering work, I have significant responsibilities across product development, project management, and business strategy. In particular, I analyze our data using SQL to identify new opportunities for site optimizations or to motivate new features. This research turns into project proposals and quarterly planning for the product team at Uplift. I also make presentations for our bi-weekly board meetings, run weekly cross-functional strategic planning meetings, and collaborate with Uplift's two co-founders on business planning and company strategy.</p>

								<p>When I'm not at work I can be found reading at the public library, spending time with friends, biking around Cambridge, or in the mountains hiking. I secretly love debugging code.</p>

								<h3>Uplift Financial</h3>
								<h5>May 2018 - Present (1 year 7 months)</h5>
								<br>
								<h4 class="major">Software Engineer</h4>
								<h5>January 2019 -  Present (1 year)</h5>
								<p>Responsible for the stability and monetization of our product: upliftfinancial.com. I'm responsible for our Kubes cluster (EKS), our deployment process, the backend website code, and integrating new business partner APIs. I'm the point of contact for the 3 person product team and provide tech support across Uplift Financial.</p>
								<h5>Key contributions:</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>Integrated 7 business partner APIs (in particular: online lenders and debt consolidation companies) that now drive 55% of monthly revenue.</li>
										<li>Refactored 6 sections of the website that were difficult to maintain and supported significant traffic or revenue.</li>
										<li>Lead the conceptualization, development, and monitoring of countless AB tests that have resulted in a cumulative 3X in revenue per visit on our web properties. These projects include: optimally sequencing our partner API calls to maximize the chance a user is approved for a personal loan, reducing our TransUnion costs by limiting credit score checks, redirecting users that are not approved for loans to debt solutions partners, and dynamically ordering our products on the website based on revenue per view.</li>
										<li>In collaboration with a designer, I developed analyses and revenue projections in support of a total rebrand of our product. The pitch was approved by Uplift's founders and the ongoing rebrand has already achieved 50% of projected profit increases.</li>
										<li>I collaborate closely with Uplift's co-founders on our annual business plans, monthly/quarterly planning, and bi-weekly presentations to our board.</li>
								</ul>
								<h4 class="major">Senior Analyst</h4>
								<h5>May 2018 -  December 2018 (7 months)</h5>
								<p>Responsible for email marketing sending infrastructure (written in Python, run with Docker/Kubernetes) and improving targeting and profitability of email campaigns.</p>
								<h5>Key contributions:</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Pitched, designed, and developed an automated test email sending tool to be used by the internal Account Management team. The tool was written in Python (Flask), had a simple HTML frontend, and was deployed on Kubernetes. I designed the tool based on conversations with the target users and created a V2 based on user feedback. The tool saves ~4 hours of Analyst and Account Manager time on a weekly basis and has been in production for over a year.</li>
									<li>Expanded email capabilities from sending 100 concurrent email templates to 500+, which increased daily profit by $2,000.</li>
									<li>Rewrote script that 1) processed revenue reporting from partner APIs and email attachments and 2) selectively transfered data from a MySQL database to a separate Postgres database, stripping out PII.</li>
									<li>Refactored email user-offer matching algorithm to use multiprocessing (written in Python) reduce the duration of daily preparation processes. This change cut down the daily run time of our core revenue-generating process by 35%.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Analysis Group</h3>
								<h5>August 2016 - March 2017 (1 year 7 months)</h5>
								<br>
								<h4 class="major">Analyst</h4>
								<h5>August 2016 - March 2017 (1 year 7 months)</h5>
								<p>At Analysis Group, I worked on multiple small case teams on projects including: government investigations, antitrust litigations, and strategy consulting projects. I used SQL, R, and Python to conduct analyses on large datasets and create tools for clients. I was the lead Analyst on 6+ cases. Outside of casework, I was elected to and co-led the Peer Mentoring Committee for over a year, mentored 4 Analysts, and taught Python and R classes during new Analyst orientation.</p>
								<h5>Key contributions:</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>Conducted analyses using SAS (SQL) on large Medicare/Medicaid datasets and proprietary company datasets. For example: an analysis of the impact of physician kick-backs on prescribing behaviour.</li>
									<li>Co-led the Peer Mentoring Committee that acted as a liason between the Analyst class (150+ Analysts) and Senior Staff for a year. I'm most proud of introducing a simple quarterly "Pulse" survey to assess Analyst job satisfaction, stress levels, and gather general feedback.</li>
									<li>Pitched, developed, and maintained five R Shiny tools for clients. These included:
									<ul>
										<li>A data exploration/visualisation tool for pharmaceutical companies to view Medicare/Medicare drug prescribing and usage data.</li>
										<li>Two dynamic damages calculators to be used in negotiations between drug companies and government agencies.</li>
										<li>A data exploration/visualisation tool to analyze the impact of a controlled substance monitoring program used by a drug distribution company.</li>
									</ul>
									</li>
